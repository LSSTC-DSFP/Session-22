    "This example should be taken mostly as a framework/outline of how to build an autoencoder. In a research setting, careful choices about loss functions and architecture should be investigated. Recent work, for example, on (non-variational) autoencoders has shown the importance of accounting for *redshift invariance* in galaxy spectra. Since the focus here is getting some practice with ML enabled visualization, these deeper questions are left for a future version of this tutorial.\n",
